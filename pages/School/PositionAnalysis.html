                    1. What did you learn from searching for and annotating the job advertisements? (1 paragraph or 4-6 complete sentences) I see that a lot of software engineering internships are remote which is great because it means there are a lot more available opportunity for me. I also saw that they usually pay relatively well compared to part-time restaurant jobs that I have had in the past. They often want you to apply externally and sometimes require a transcript.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Based on your academic, professional, and personal experiences to date, which position would you be the most qualified for? Why? (1 paragraph or 4-6 complete sentences) Of the three positions posted above I believe I am most qualified for the first one since they are seeking juniors, and I am a junior. But the other two have signifcantly less qualifications so by some logic I am more qualified for those jobs even tho I meet more of the qualifications for the first job. The second job is the most interesting to me because it is dealing with linux software which I am passionate about and its onsite which means ill be able to join a community and make connections with people.
                    <br><br>
                    3. What skills or experiences might you need to gain to become a top candidate for one of these positions? (1 paragraph or 4-6 complete sentences) I think an important metric towards gaining Candice would be a high gpa since many of these jobs ask for a transcript. Another metric might be having interesting GitHub projects available on your resume or experience in a similar field. I have heard at higher levels there are technical interviews which can set you apart from other candidates for software engineering roles, but I have yet to experience one while looking for an internship.
