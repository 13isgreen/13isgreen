Lockheed Martin
<br>
<br>
To whom it may concern I am writing this letter to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position, as advertised by Lockheed Martin.
<br>
<br>
I am an enthusiastic student with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree in Computer Software and from the University of Central Florida. I have a working knowledge of the principles and practices of software engineering and more than a passing familiarity with the tools of software testing and programming.
<br>
<br>
What makes me a strong candidate for this internship is that I possess the right combination of technical and soft skills to be successful at this level. My experience has taught me that communication, collaboration, and problem-solving are essential elements of success in software engineering. Not only do I have a great work ethic when tackling a project on my own, but I understand the value of collaboration when taking on a complex task. I've become quite familiar with working in teams when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting problems.
I have completed many group projects with my classmates the results to which can be seen on my GitHub page referenced in my resume.
<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that I would be a great addition to the team and an asset to Lockheed Martin. I am confident that my knowledge of software engineering along with my strong communication and problem-solving skills would be of great use. I would be delighted to have the opportunity to demonstrate those qualities and contribute to the success of the organization. My number is 904 549 31 31, address is 4770 grace farms ln, and email address nathanbremerdev@gmail.com where I can be at any time of the day.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of meeting with you to further discuss my candidacy.
